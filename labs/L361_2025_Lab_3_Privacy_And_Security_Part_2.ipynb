        "The authors proposed a protocol for the secure aggregation of model updates in a Federated Learning setting.\n",
        "SMPC algorithms allow a group of _mutually distrustful parties_ to compute a function over their private inputs without revealing any information about their inputs to one another.\n",
        "In Federated Learning, users can compute the average of their model updates without revealing any information about their model updates to the other actors.\n",

Increasing either of these parametes result an exponential increase in communication cost. Therefore, when it comes to FL in communication restricted environments using Secure Aggregation, we might need to make a decision whether we want to train a larger model or with more clients per round or find a balance between both. In an setting where communication is not restricted we still need to consider the effect of these values when using Secure Aggregation as it might effect the speed of convergence and could amplify negative behaviours such a late model updates and the periodic client behaviours.\n",

        "\n",
        "To understand to effect os Secure Aggregation in a real FL setting we need separate whether a the system is in a cross-silo or cross-device setting. The use of the proposed algorithm would increase the computation and communication cost on the client side with the complexity of O($n^2 +kn$) and O(n+k) respectively where n is the number of clients and k is number of model parameters. In a cross-device setting clients might dropout during a training round due to their network conditions, battery life or other external reasons which is not as common in a cross-silo setting as they tend to be more stable. Therefore increasing the computational and communication cost in a cross-device setting might result in otherwise available data to be lost due to the additional overhead. Consequently, to use secure aggregation with a large number of client in a cross-device setting the number of model parameters should be kept low compared to the number of clients as it increases computational costs on the client side by $n^2$. Additionally the larger number of clients would also require more computational resources available to the server as the computational cost complexity there is O($kn^2$) and the communication cost is O($n^2$ + kn) where both increased by the square of the number of clients. Although the computational cost is greatly affected by the number of clients, communication cost is equally influenced by the number of clients and model parameters allowing a balance between both when it comes to round configuration. On the other hand, in a cross-silo setting where clients can be assumed to be more stable and fewer, we can train models with more parameters as well as use less powerful servers.\n",
