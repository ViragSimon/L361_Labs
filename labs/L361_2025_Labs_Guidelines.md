# L361 2025 - Labs guidelines

The Labs are an essential part of the course.
They are designed to help you understand the material covered in the lectures and to give you hands-on experience with the tools and techniques used in the field of Machine Learning.
The labs are also an opportunity for you to practice your programming skills and to get feedback on your work.
In-person attendance is strongly recommended for all Lab sessions that will be held in the Computer Lab, room SW02, on the following Tuesdays 3-4 pm before the lecture: 4th February, 11th February, 18th February, and 25th February.

The Labs' coursework have to completed individually; each Lab is worth 12.5% of total grade.
The total worth of the Labs is thus 50% of the final grade.
Take advantage of the Lab sessions to ask questions and clarify any doubts you may have.
Try to inspect the coursework for a Lab in advance.
The next Lab will be made available on this repository in advance to allow for preparation.
It is expected to complete the coursework in the Lab session and in your own time (1 hour may not be enough depending on the student's ability).

The Labs are designed to be completed in Python using LightningAI sessions or your personal machine.
We recommend forking this repository and cloning it to the machine you will be using.
Be aware that some resources have to be downloaded with `git lfs` (Large File Storage).
It is expected to use some sort of computing resources even though, in most cases, the Labs can be completed on a laptop.
Questions are embedded within the Notebooks and the answer must be put after them clearly visible.
Please, try to respect further potential guidelines provided in the Lab Notebooks.
All Labs include more difficult additional questions for MPhil/Part III students.

The Labs' coursework will be submitted through Moodle.
Guidelines on the modality of submission are provided in each Labs' notebook.

The last Lab session has a new format.
The objective of the session is to provide feedback on the projects and present preliminary results.
As such, attendance is mandatory.
In case of absence, the student must provide a valid reason.
Preliminary results are expected to be a deliverable of (**at least one**) the following types:

- Code developed for the project;
- Introduction and Background sections of the report;
- Numerical results in the form of plots and/or tables.
